* inline elements:
    * don't take more space than thier content
    * will sit side by side (inline) as space allows
    * span, img, strong, em, a, etc.
* block elements:
    * take entire width of page regardless of content
    * div, p, hx, ul, li, etc.
* can nest inline elemnts inside block elemnts but not block elements inside inline elements
    * i.e. an anchor (a) inside a paragraph (p) for a link.
* can nest block elements inside block elements.
